# Overview

Our Github organisation space is for BaBi Network sites to share code and pertinent documentation. The Born and Bred in (BaBi) project is a network of local electronic birth cohort studies. Supported by the Born in Bradford programme, BaBi sites invite pregnant women to join the project and allow health researchers to join together routinely collected data about them and their baby. Born in Bradfordâ€™s BiB4All is the co-ordinating centre and the pioneering site for this new approach to harnessing routine data at a local level. 

BiB4All leads the BaBi network; a group of local birth e-cohort studies that work together to link routine data with the aim to improve the health and wellbeing of families through research.
